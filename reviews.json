Kebanyakan orang salah mengira nasi ulam adalah nasi uduk. Padahal nasi ulam adalah nasi putih yang dimasak pulen dengan ditaburi bihun goreng, timun iris tipis, kacang giling/tumbuk, bawang goreng dan dimakan bersama kuah semur tahu/kentang. Di Bang Sanip, pilihan lauk terdiri dari telor semur, telor balado, telor dadar, dendeng sapi, dan perkedel kentang. Jangan lupa minta daun kemangi. Sip dah. Yang saya suka dari Bang Sanip adalah kuah semur nya yang lumayan medok dan sambal kacang yg pedas. Selamat mencoba.

Maklum kebanyakan penjual nasi ulam adalah penjual gerobakan. \"sy mampir ke Lembur Kuring nu BiBet minggu lalu...ikan gurame cabe ijonya mantap sekali...mengingatkan saya terhadap 'sambel favorit keluarga'....kombinasi gurih, manis dan aroma lombok ijo gorengnya serasi sekali.Pas...Karedoknya juga enak dan segar.

As my palate grows, I want to know if my preference also changed.     The texture wasn't right, I think.

Agak menyesal pesen bakmi campurnya, karena ternyata rasa babi merah nya kurang yummy. Lebih rekomen di ayam nya saja. potongan dagingnya juga banyak, makan sampai terkahirpun masih bisa di gado dagingnya.   Saya gak pesen side dish (somay, pangsit goreng, baso goreng) karena liat harganya saja sudah bikin melotot. hahaha.  Memang harganya lumayan mahal yah, saya dan pacar agak kaget pas bayar di kasir.   Tempat makannya luas, tapi waktu saya dateng hari sabtu siang sekitar pukul 12an, tempatnya sepi. awalnya ragu2 untuk masuk.   selain bakmi, ada juga menu2 lain seperti nasi bakar, kuotie, berbagai kerupuk, cemilan di toples.","translatedText":"pricey and has ordinary taste, those are the two words i could describe about bakmi asuk to be honest, long time ago in my childhood, i tried the bakmi before and since then i have not been a fan of them (and bakmi karet overall, but i have ever had the good one!) as my palate grows, i want to know if my preference also changed the texture wasn't right, i think the chicken, however, was quite nice, but their bakso goreng wasn't satisfying i don't know if i actually went on the wrong day though as generally everyone recommends this bakmi elizasaliman wordpress com, I think, this noodle is quite recommendable to try his noodle type, a kind of noodle krekot, noodles and bakmi2 noodles with a typical noodle strong in boiled chicken and noodle texture itself this time I ate a new menu, noodle mix so there are red pig and chicken pieces (can choose between thigh / chest) somewhat regret his noodles mixed, because it turns out his red pork is less yummy more recommendable in his chicken only pieces of meat are also many, eat until the end can still be in gado meat I am not pesen side dish (somay, fried dumplings, fried baso) because the price is just tough hahaha indeed the price is quite expensive yah, me and boyfriend rather shocked pas pay at the cash register the place to eat is wide, but when I arrived on Saturday afternoon around 12an, the place was quiet originally hesitant to enter besides noodles, there are also other men2 like grilled rice, kuotie, various crackers, snacks in jars","foodPolarity":"NEGATIVE","servicePolarity":"UNKNOWN","pricePolarity":"NEGATIVE","ambiencePolarity":"UNKNOWN","foodPolarityInteger":-1,"servicePolarityInteger":0,"pricePolarityInteger":-1,"ambiencePolarityInteger":0}

Jarang nulis review tapi ini lumayan mengecewakan. oh ya tempatnya agak kurang dibersihin, masih ada tisu dikaki, terus juga kayak becek2 gitu ada air di bawah kaki.  kayaknya gaakan mau kesini lagi hm","translatedText":"first come here with friends so the lift kebuka and look around it ga ga appropriate perception / ga according to expectations see review in zomato pretty, for me and teman2 ga as expected table and chair ga proportional, taste child tk eat dimeja (short chair) pas nyampe only 2 tables filled waiters less intercepting / spry next commentin the food, for a reasonably pricey price, ga worth it dirty dishes, but the price is good but it fits pasaji ditajiin gitu fingerprints, whether remah2 what it btw we pesen caesar salad, salmon fried rice, same salad also (forgot its name) taste so so, but ga too worth the same price the comfort of the place because the chairs and tables are not worth it ga ga comfortable too pas dateng lonely, so more ga awkward for foto2 rarely write reviews but this was quite disappointing oh yes the place is somewhat less cleaned, there is still a tissue on foot, continue also like becek2 so there is water under the feet I think I want to go here again hm","foodPolarity":"NEGATIVE","servicePolarity":"NEGATIVE","pricePolarity":"NEGATIVE","ambiencePolarity":"NEGATIVE","foodPolarityInteger":-1,"servicePolarityInteger":-1,"pricePolarityInteger":-1,"ambiencePolarityInteger":-1}

Jadi, ini jenis bakmi yang penyajiannya bakmi dan daging (ayam) yang dipisah masing2 mangkuk.   Untuk bakminya sendiri, merupakan jenis bakmi yg bukan termasuk golongan bakmi karet tapi juga bukan bakmi yang halus2 tipis gitu. Nah untuk ayamnya, kalau kamu beruntung kamu masih bisa pilih (dada/ paha) tapi, kalo saya dan pacar yang cuma bisa dtg hari sabtu, pasti udh gak bisa dapet pilihan dada/ paha. Mereka sebutnya campur. Yang dimaksud campur adalah kulit, daging paha dan dada. Jadi yah campur, tapi itu juga enak dan lbh banyak dagingnya.   Soal kuahnya? beuhh, jangan di tanya.. Saya selalu nambah kuah nya, karna saya suka banget sama kuahnya. Buat km yg suka makan ceker (kaki ayam) km juga bisa pesen loh..   Pokoknya ini bakmi yang HARUS PAKE BANGET BUAT DICOBA (hahh, ngileerr)","translatedText":"this favorite bangett from college days, from the small place, skrg dah gedean, sempet moved2 walopun moved deket2 aja its noodle noodle rubber, chicken in separate bowl, really good from college demen really eat here, 1st rank of chicken noodle (halal) in the world (kinda lebay but really) so, this kind of noodle that the serving noodles and meat (chicken) are separated masing2 bowl for its own bakminya, is a type of noodle which is not including the class of noodles but also not noodles bakmi yang halus2 so thin well for the chicken, if you are lucky you can still choose (chest / thigh) but, if I and girlfriend who can only dtg Saturday, certainly udh can not get the choice of chest / thigh they call it mixed What is plus is skin, thigh and chest so well mixed, but it's also tasty and more meat about the gravy?

Pas banget mau makan siang disini, seluruh ruangan bau karbol. Sangat mengurangi nafsu makan! Berasa makan didalam toilet terminal bus. Mohon perhatiannya ya. Minimal sapu dan pel ruang makan 2 jam sebelum buka. Rasa makanan nggak enak. Titik. Mau makan di botani harga di bawah 20 rb? Di rawon goendoel ini sdh dgn teh tawar.. Murah yaa.. Yaa tapi porsinya minimal sesuai harga yaa.. Buat ibu2 yg takut gemuk dan kolestrol yaa cucook aja.. Bisa ditambah telur asin, perkedel kentang, gorengan2, yaah kira2 40 rb an kenyaang deh.. Paket apa yaa namanya lupa lg paket Rp. 18.000,- boleh di coba rawonnya enak kok.. Sehabis nonton di Djakarta Theater, gw sempet nyebrang ke Sarinah dan melewati counter My Cha ini. Karena waktu itu haus banget, akhirnya dicobalah Yakult Green Tea sama Yakult Grapefruit (Yes, I'm a big fan of anything Yakult-y :D) Rasanya oke lah. Yakult Green Tea nya kerasa banget green tea nya. Yakult Grapefruit agak sedikit terlalu manis. But, overally, oke kok.  Ini diaa tempat favorite ibu2 bidan cimanggis.. Setiap acara pertemuan bidan2 pasti kita booking disini.. Karena Pelayanannya oke, tempatnya nyaman, makanannya enak.. Saladnya apalagi, yahut abissss 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 makanan yg lainnya jg enak2 lho, nasgornya enyakkk, mie tek2nya enyakkk.. Pokoknya mantappplaah 😍😍😍,inilah persinggahan makan siangku yang yahud, biasanya kami order sapo tahu, tom yam, nasi goreng, aneka juice dan soto ayam... yang mirip dengan buatan ibuku. Lebih nikmat bumbu padangnya jika makan masakan padang pakai gulai dan masakan padang dengan dendeng boleh minta ngak biar kita makan bareng-bareng disini   \"This is the first Singaporean Sandwich ice cream I've tried. And as people said, first love is difficult to forget, since then I always come back, even had tried several ice cream sandwiches from various seller    Favorite Flavor: Rum Raisin and Cookies&Cream! Not too sweet and the flavour is well-tasted. Curious for their Green Tea though, but I think those 2 flavors are the safest if you just tried this ice cream    Toppings: there are lots of them such as marshmallow, almond, corn flakes, but I suggest to try frozen chocolate, since it's likely less messy    Location: it's a small stall beside Pizza Marzano (in front of Periplus)    Overall: so far the cheapest and worth money + taste ice cream sandwhich I've ever tried. I always opted for this one if I'm too broke for Cold Stone lol!\"  Raja Soto di gading serpong (di zomato belum ada yang di serpong) rasa sotonya ok. harga termasuk murah untuk soto. (tapi tiap mau pesan soto ceker kenapa selalu kosong ya?) untuk kantong mahasiswa boleh sering2 mampir ke sini. Pertama kalinya dateng kesini, langsung pesen seporsi bakmi yamin manis & seporsi bakso kuah. Rasa bakmi yamin manisnya hambar banget, nothing special. Rasanya kayak mie polos dikasih kecap dikit, pas disajikannya juga mienya dingin. Untuk baksonya lumayan enak, tapi kuahnya biasa aja.

{"rawText":"Pertama mampir ke Anomali Menteng, bagian dalam cafe ini memang terlihat nyaman. Begitu masuk mata langsung jelalatan nyari spot yang cocok buat duduk santai sambil menikmati iced cappuccino. Akhirnya terpilihlah sebuah sudut duduk yang dihiasi bantal dan meja bulat. Puas duduk-duduk, objek mata jelalatan ini pun pindah ke beberapa rak yang ada di dalam cafe yang memajang berbagai alat brewing dan juga kopi olahan yang sudah dikemas. Lucu dan menambah keabsahan cafe ini sebagai bagian dari rantai panjang pembuatan kopi dari hulu ke hilir. Selain itu menabah nilai dekor juga.    By the way, iced cappuccino yang saya pesan terasa strong. Nyaris sakau *lol*. Kalau bukan pecinta kopi mungkin udah dibuang kali ya (aku juga masih di tahap belajar mencintai kok.. ihiy) Sayang banget ga nanya ke barista apa jenis kopi yang ia pakai. Tapi yang jelas baristanya perhatian, mungkin karena ngeliat tampang costumernya kusut, ia pun memberikan kata-kata motivasi. Berista Teguh gak sih!,selalu suka kerja disini, enak dibuat santai hanya sekedar ngobrol atau curcol atau cuman diem-dieman aja sama pacar, yang penting suasananya enak aja sih. kopi nya lezat dan waitress nya juga ga ngecewain.. klo lagi bete pengen hanya sekedar browsing hal-hal yang ga penting, juga ser disini, cuman yang susah nyari spot yang enak.. colokan banyak tapi hanya tempat2 tertentu aja yang mojok jadi ga keganggu dengan orang yang lain,1.0 for cleanliness - unfortunately there was a lot of hair on the floor under the tables and chairs were dirty.  1.0 for food - paid 107,000 for grilled chicken and iced coffee. Chicken was very dry. Rice cold, almost frozen (looks like they keep it in the fridge and warm up in the microwave but didnt warm it up enough).   Coffee was ok. But somehow they managed to charge me for large size instead of regular size that i asked for.  I buy their coffee for brewing at home. And its good. But just stick to coffee.","translatedText":"first stop to anomalous menteng, the inside of this cafe does look comfortable so enter the eye straight jelalatan nyari spot that is suitable for sitting relax while enjoying iced cappuccino finally elected a sitting corner decorated with pillows and round tables Satisfied sitting, this jelalatan eye object moved to some of the shelves in the cafe displaying various brewing tools and also processed coffee that has been packaged funny and adds to the authenticity of this cafe as part of a long chain of coffee making from upstream to downstream besides it also has the value of the decoration by the way, the iced cappuccino I ordered was strong almost sakau * lol * if not coffee lovers may have been thrown away times yes (I'm also still in the learning stage loves kok ihiy) dear ga nanya to barista what kind of coffee that he use but a clear baristanya attention, perhaps because ngeliat look costumer tangled, he also gave the words of motivation berista teguh not hell !, always likes to work here, nice made relax just chatting or curcol or just diem-dieman aja boyfriend, the important atmosphere is good aja hell his coffee is delicious and his waitress is also ga ngecewain klo again bete just want to browse things that are not important, also ser here, cuman a hard nyari a nice spot many plugs but only certain places aja mojok so ga ga annoyance with other people, 1 0 for cleanliness - unfortunately there was a lot of hair on the floor under the tables and chairs were dirty 1 0 for food - paid 107,000 for grilled chicken and iced coffee chicken was very dry rice cold, almost frozen (looks like they keep it in the fridge and warm up in the microwave but didnt warm it up enough) coffee was ok but somehow they managed to charge me for large size instead of regular size that i asked for i buy their coffee for brewing at home and its good but just stick to coffee","foodPolarity":"NEGATIVE","servicePolarity":"POSITIVE","pricePolarity":"UNKNOWN","ambiencePolarity":"POSITIVE","foodPolarityInteger":-1,"servicePolarityInteger":1,"pricePolarityInteger":0,"ambiencePolarityInteger":1}

{"rawText":"Went for dinner on a weekday. The food was decent enough, although nothing really jumped as \"\"delish\"\" or \"\"wow\"\", but it wasn't bad either.   However, a couple things really turned me off : 1) mice. mice, mice, mice. we sat in one of the booth tables and had a clear view of mice frolicking around the wooden railings on the wall, on the cabinet across from the DJ station, along the platform that leads to the bathroom and kitchen. 2) the ambience.

Tempat ini sudah sangat banyak berubah dari awal berdiri, dan semakin bagus. Citarasa makanan juga enak dan harga tidak terlalu mahal. Kadang sore hari ada pertunjukan tari-tarian yang cukup menghibur. Konro Bakarnya OKE punya, dan meskipun tampilan Gurame Gorengnya tidak menarik (hehehe..), tapi rasanya boleh diadu. Sop Buntut?

{"rawText":"I am a frequent customer at Sumire. Sumire has been a family favorite since the early 2000s but I am sad to say that the food has dropped in quality since then. In particular, their sashimi and sushi are lacking in freshness and most of the beef dishes are a bit hard. The last time I came, I ordered the gyudon - which was decent, but the rice was too damp due to too much sauce and the egg was slightly overcooked. On a good note, the chicken teriyaki is probably my favorite thing on the menu.   Service staff are very friendly but in my experience the food service tends to be relatively slower than at other restaurants.   On the plus side, the ambiance at Sumire is very nice and relaxing and it is still a good place to visit with family or a group of friends for some lunch or dinner. But, in my opinion, the food and speed of service could use some work.,this is one of the nicest japanese restaurant in my opinion...good classic japanese style decoration with nice ambience..the food is tasty and fresh..my favorite was the set lunch...especially the daily fish..good food..reasonable price...besides that a bit steep. one of my fav lunch places.,kmrn ini baru saja saya makan sumire sama orang tua saya.. dan kita banyak pesen sashimi ya.. tapi ternyata sashimi nya kurang fresh.. mungkin quality nya sudah agak menurun.. tetapi saya makan gindara nya masih cukup enak.. kushiyaki nya juga masih okay tp hanya kecewa terhadap qualitas sashimi and sushi nya..","translatedText":"i am a frequent customer at sumire sumire has been a family favorite since the early 2000s but i am sad to say that the food has dropped in quality since then in particular, their sashimi and sushi are lacking in freshness and most of the beef dishes are a bit hard the last time i came, i ordered the gyudon - which was decent, but the rice was too damp due to too much sauce and the egg was slightly overcooked on a good note, the chicken teriyaki is probably my favorite thing on the menu service staff are very friendly but in my experience the food service tends to be relatively slower than at other restaurants on the plus side, the ambiance at sumire is very nice and relaxing and it is still a good place to visit with family or a group of friends for some lunch or dinner but, in my opinion, the food and speed of service could use some work ,this is one of the nicest japanese restaurant in my opinion good classic japanese style decoration with nice ambience the food is tasty and fresh my favorite was the set lunch especially the daily fish good food reasonable price besides that a bit steep one of my fav lunch places , this kmrn just I eat sumire with my parents and we got a lot of sashimi ya but it turns out his sashimi is less fresh maybe its quality has decreased somewhat but I eat his gindara is still quite tasty his kushiyaki is still okay tp just disappointed to the quality of his sashimi and sushi","foodPolarity":"NEGATIVE","servicePolarity":"POSITIVE","pricePolarity":"POSITIVE","ambiencePolarity":"POSITIVE","foodPolarityInteger":-1,"servicePolarityInteger":1,"pricePolarityInteger":1,"ambiencePolarityInteger":1}
